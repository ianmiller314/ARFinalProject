The goal of this project is to implement the Vazquez-Alvarez: AR Sound Garden paper.
The project will utilize Adobe Aero and contain several unique totems, each with associated earcons.
When approached and interacted with, these totems will relay audio information to the user.
The theming of the garden and corresponding information is yet to be determined.
