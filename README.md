The goal of this project is to create a simple interactive AR game for a mobile device.
The game will most likely be puzzle/trivia based and will include stages that require moving around and exploring the AR environment.
The API I will likely use it Adobe Aero as it has an intuitive interface and runs well on mobile devices.
